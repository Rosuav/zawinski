* Address Book with 
  - Groups by Tags (like Gmail, PMMail)
  - search for duplicates and resolve with merge (like Gmail)
  - auto-save addressees on Send
  - import/export Vcard, csv
* Read Messages
  - select HTML on/off
* Write messages
  - canned responses - boilerplate text for editing
  - multiple selectable sig blocks - append one to message on send
* Send messages
  - check for attachments, prompt if none and if keywords in message suggest one
* Store profile/config settings, addresses boilerplate responses & sigs in plain text files 

Nice to have
------------

* Colour scheme selectable (use Chromes from TBird? looks like CSS stuff there)
* VCard import/export
* Preview pane
* Attachment manager - dispose of incoming attachments to save space
